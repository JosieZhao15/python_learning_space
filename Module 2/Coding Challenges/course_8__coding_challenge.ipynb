    "üêù I forgot to say it earlier, but it is better to call your set `korean_cities` and `french_cities` instead of city, since it is a set that contains all the cities in those countries. It makes the condition more meaningful as well: `if city_name in korean_cities`. If it is written as `if city_name in korean_city` and they didn't read the first lines carefully, one might think `korean_city` is a string of one city, and that `if city_name in korean_city` checks if the string `korean_city` contains the substring `city_name`.\n",
